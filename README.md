# Multi-Step-Form-Calculator
A multi step form that runs a calculation with the input values using HTML, CSS, jQuery, and PHP.

The initial thought came from a client request to have a multi step form that could operate as a calculator and let the user know the frequency on which they should feed their dog. 

As the website was developed on wordpress, the client side uses HTML CSS and jQuery to handle the input and display of the form. We use jQuery Ajax to push the data to the server side where PHP handles the request and pushes back the output to the frontend. 

This is just a template. The logic and validation has not been complete but it illustrates how to solve a multi form calculation request.
